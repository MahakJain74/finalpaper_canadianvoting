## Overview of the paper
This repository explores the Canadian GSS 2013 data to better understand factors that may affect voter participation.

## Obtaining data

The data is taken from General Social Survey (GSS), Cycle 27, 2013 (version 2): Social Identity, through CHASS website, accessible over 25 different universities.  

It is also included in this repository, in the directory "inputs/data/AAEV5tkb.txt."

## Preprocess data

After obtaining the STATA data on GSS, the script "01-data_cleaning.R", located in "scripts/01-data_cleaning.R", can be used to preprocess the data and save the file as a csv file in the directory "outputs/data/raw_data.csv" .


## Building the Report

There is a RMarkDown document located in "outputs/paper/paper.Rmd". This file is used to produce the report "placeholdername". It contains the R code to produce the graphs and the report format code. The reference used are also located in "outputs/paper/references.bib".
